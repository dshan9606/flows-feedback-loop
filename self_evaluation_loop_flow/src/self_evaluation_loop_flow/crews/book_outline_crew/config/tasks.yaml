  description: >
    Create a book outline with chapters in sequential order. 
    Ensure that each chapter has a title and a brief description that highlights the topics and subtopics to be covered.
    It's important to note that each chapter is only going to be 3,000 words or less.
    Also, make sure that you do not duplicate any chapters or topics in the outline.

    Topic: {topic}
    Plot: {plot}
    Characters: {characters}
    Feedback (if any): {feedback}
